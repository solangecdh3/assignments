        "In data science, we often need to find relevant resources and learn how to ask the appropriate questions (let's be honest....using Google) to find those resources. In this assignment you will be challenged to learn to use another Python data analysis library called `Pandas`.  This library is useful for organizing data into rows and columns making it easy to clean, analyze, and manipulate data. You've been introduced to it in class, but that challenge here it to use what you've learned so far and apply it to another new library.  Ready?? Here we go!   \n",

You'll use both to practice `pip install` and loading a csv file!\n",

This can be tricky!  Particularly since we're working with Colab at the moment... look up how to upload the data to Colab (there are LOTS of ways to do this!) Once you do that, import the data using `pandas.read_csv()` methods and store the data in a new variable called `penguins_uploaded`. _If this is too difficult, just use the `penguins` data from part **a** for part the remaining questions._  \n",

        "\n",
        "**(i)** Let's do some basic stats.  Use the `.describe()` method to return some descriptive statistics on the data. If you use this method on the full dataframe, do you notice any columns that are missing?  Why do you think that is?\n",
